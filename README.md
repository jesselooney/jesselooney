# Hello!

I am a hobbyist programmer, poet, dancer, game master, and roleplayer who loves learning about life, the universe, and everything.

If you're looking to explore my repos, be warned that I have a lot of old and random stuff collecting dust. Here are some of the more recent and more complete projects:
  - [vivado-report-parser](https://github.com/jesselooney/vivado-report-parser) is my first published Python package, designed to make it easier to read out data from Xilinx Vivado's report files.
  - [hhs-monument-literary-magazine](https://github.com/jesselooney/hhs-monument-literary-magazine) is the full LaTeX source of a literary magazine I helped put together (and did all the typesetting for) during my senior year of high school.
  - ...more to come?
